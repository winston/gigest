# GIGEST

**GI**tHub**GE**m**ST**ats. Discover Gems usage for a GitHub user or org!

Do you want to know which are the most frequently used Gems in a GitHub account?
GIGEST gives you the ability to do that by inspecting the Gemfiles across all repos for a GitHub user or org.


## Installation

    gem install 'gigest'


## Usage

1) Authenticate. You have [4 ways to do it](http://octokit.github.io/octokit.rb/#Authentication).

    analytics = Gigest::Analytics.new(login: "winston", password: "secret")

Authenticating with your username and password will give GIGEST access to public and private repos within your GitHub account and organization/s.

Authenticating with an OAuth access token will give GIGEST access to repos depending on the [scopes
which the OAuth access token was granted](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes).

2) Process for a GitHub user or GitHub Organization.

    analytics.process_for("winston")

This can take a while if the GitHub account contains A LOT of repos. Sit back and relax.

3) Get summary.

    analytics.summary

Returns you a Hash in the format:

    {
      gem1: [repo1, repo2],
      gem2: [repo1, repo2, repo3, repo4]
    }

4) Get statistics.

    analytics.statistics

Returns you a Hash in the format:

    {
      gem1: 2, # number of times seen
      gem2: 4
    }
